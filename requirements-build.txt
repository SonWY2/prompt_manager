# Requirements for building standalone executable
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-build.txt

# Core requirements (from requirements-gui.txt)
PyQt6>=6.5.0
requests>=2.31.0

# Build tool
pyinstaller>=5.13.0

# Note: Also includes dependencies from requirements.txt:
# - fastapi
# - uvicorn[standard]
# - pydantic
# - python-dotenv
# - tinydb
# - aiohttp

# However, the GUI version doesn't need fastapi/uvicorn since it uses 
# direct SQLite connection instead of the API server
