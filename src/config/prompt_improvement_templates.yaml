      # Advanced Prompt Enhancement Meta-Prompt

      You are an expert in LLM prompt engineering with deep knowledge of the 26 principles from "Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4" (Bsharat et al., 2023). Your task is to analyze and enhance prompts to achieve up to 57.7% quality improvement and 36.4% correctness improvement.

      ## Input Prompt
      ```
      {main_prompt}
      ```

      ## Critical Instruction: Language Preservation
      **IMPORTANT: Detect the language of the input prompt and provide the enhanced prompt in THE SAME LANGUAGE. If the input is in Korean, output in Korean. If in English, output in English. Maintain the original language throughout the enhanced prompt.**

      ---

      ## Enhancement Process

      ### Phase 1: Comprehensive Analysis

      Systematically evaluate the current prompt across five dimensions:

      #### 1.1 Prompt Structure and Clarity
      Assess:
      - [ ] Is the intended audience explicitly specified?
      - [ ] Does it use affirmative directives ("do") vs. negative language ("don't")?
      - [ ] Is structured formatting used (###Instruction###, ###Example###, ###Question###)?
      - [ ] Are delimiters appropriately employed to separate sections?
      - [ ] Does it use output primers (ending with the start of desired output)?
      - [ ] Are leading words like "think step by step" present where needed?

      #### 1.2 Specificity and Information
      Evaluate:
      - [ ] Does it include few-shot examples when beneficial?
      - [ ] Is the explanation level clearly specified (expert/beginner/child-friendly)?
      - [ ] Does it address potential biases explicitly?
      - [ ] Are requirements stated in concrete, measurable terms?
      - [ ] Are keywords, regulations, or constraints clearly specified?
      - [ ] Is the desired output format explicitly described?

      #### 1.3 User Interaction and Engagement
      Check:
      - [ ] Should the model ask clarifying questions before responding?
      - [ ] Would an interactive, multi-turn approach be more effective?
      - [ ] Is there opportunity for the model to elicit more precise requirements?

      #### 1.4 Content and Language Style
      Review:
      - [ ] Are there unnecessary polite phrases ("please", "thank you", "if you don't mind")?
      - [ ] Would imperative phrases ("Your task is", "You MUST") add clarity?
      - [ ] Would penalties or incentives ("I'm going to tip $xxx") improve performance?
      - [ ] Is a specific role assignment beneficial?
      - [ ] Should the response tone be specified (formal/casual/technical)?
      - [ ] Are there words or phrases that should be repeated for emphasis?

      #### 1.5 Complex Tasks and Reasoning
      Determine:
      - [ ] Should the task be broken into simpler sequential steps?
      - [ ] Would Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improve the output?
      - [ ] For coding tasks, are multi-file generation instructions needed?
      - [ ] Does the task require combining CoT with few-shot examples?
      - [ ] Should the model be instructed to show intermediate reasoning?

      ---

      ### Phase 2: Principle-Based Enhancement

      Apply relevant principles strategically. **Do not force all principles**—select based on context:

      #### Category A: Prompt Structure and Clarity

      **Principle 2 - Audience Integration**
      ```

      ```
      Explicitly state: keywords to include, length constraints, format requirements, tone specifications
      ```
      *Apply when: Output has specific requirements*

      **Principle 26 - Style Matching**
      ```
      "Use the same language/style/tone as the provided [paragraph/example]"
      ```
      *Apply when: Consistency with existing content is needed*

      #### Category C: User Interaction and Engagement

      **Principle 14 - Question Elicitation**
      ```
      "From now on, ask me questions to gather all necessary information before providing your answer"
      ```
      *Apply when: Requirements are unclear or task is exploratory*

      **Principle 15 - Interactive Teaching**
      ```
      "Teach me [topic] and include a test at the end. Let me know if my answers are correct without providing answers beforehand"
      ```
      *Apply when: Learning or comprehension verification is the goal*

      #### Category D: Content and Language Style

      **Principle 1 - Conciseness**
      ```
      Remove: "please", "if you don't mind", "thank you", "I would like to", "could you"
      Replace with: Direct imperatives
      ```
      *Apply when: Efficiency and directness are priorities*

      ```
      Repeat critical keywords or requirements 2-3 times throughout the prompt
      ```
      *Apply when: Specific constraints must not be violated*

      #### Category E: Complex Tasks and Coding

      **Principle 3 - Task Decomposition**
      ```
      Break into: "First, do X. Then, do Y. Finally, do Z."
      Or use interactive multi-turn approach
      ```
      *Apply when: Task is complex with multiple sub-goals*

      **Principle 21 - Detailed Writing**
      ```
      "Write a detailed [essay/analysis/report] on [topic] by adding all necessary information including [specific aspects]"
      ```
      *Apply when: Comprehensive coverage is needed*

      ```
      *Apply when: Extending existing content*

      ---

      ### Phase 3: Generate Enhanced Prompt

      **Remember: Output in the SAME LANGUAGE as the input prompt.**

      Create the enhanced prompt following this structure:

      ```
      [ENHANCED PROMPT IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS INPUT]

      <Include relevant principles applied above>
      ```

      ---

      ### Phase 4: Enhancement Summary

      ✓ Maintain the core intent and goal of the original prompt  
      ✓ Balance conciseness with necessary detail
      ✓ Consider the model size (larger models benefit more from advanced principles)
      ✓ Test if each principle actually adds value
      ✓ Preserve the original language of the input prompt

      ### DON'T:
      ✗ Apply all 26 principles indiscriminately
      ✗ Make the prompt overly complex
      ✗ Change the fundamental goal of the original prompt
      ✗ Add unnecessary verbosity in the name of "enhancement"
      ✗ Forget that simpler is often better for straightforward tasks
      ✗ Change the language of the output prompt

      ---

      ## Now Execute

      Analyze the input prompt and generate:
      1. **Analysis**: Brief assessment of current prompt's strengths and weaknesses
      2. **Enhanced Prompt**: Improved version **IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS INPUT**

  stage1_adapt: |
    # ADAPT Meta-Prompt for Self-Discover

    ## Instructions

    Rephrase and specify each of the following reasoning module descriptions to make them more specific and helpful for improving the particular prompt shown below.

    ## Selected Reasoning Modules

    {selected_modules}

    ## Original Prompt

    ```
    {main_prompt}
    ```

    ## Your Task

    For each of the selected reasoning modules listed above, adapt and rephrase the description to be more specific to improving this prompt. The adapted descriptions should:

    1. Maintain the core reasoning approach of the original module
    2. Be tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of prompt improvement
    3. Provide actionable guidance that is directly applicable to enhancing this type of prompt
    4. Be more concrete and specific than the original general description

    **Example of adaptation:**
    - Original: "Break the problem into sub-problems"
    - Adapted for prompt improvement: "Identify each component of the prompt (role, task, constraints, output format) and optimize them separately"

    Output the adapted reasoning module descriptions as a numbered list, maintaining the correspondence with the original selected modules.

  stage1_implement: |
    # IMPLEMENT Meta-Prompt for Self-Discover

    ## Instructions

    Operationalize the adapted reasoning module descriptions into an actionable reasoning structure for improving the prompt. The structure should be in JSON format with clear step-by-step instructions.

    ## Adapted Reasoning Module Descriptions

    {adapted_modules}

    ## Original Prompt

    ```
    {main_prompt}
    ```

    ## Your Task

    Based on the adapted reasoning module descriptions provided above, create a detailed reasoning structure in JSON format for improving the given prompt. The structure should:

    1. **Be in valid JSON format** with clear key-value pairs
    2. **Specify concrete steps** that integrate the adapted reasoning modules
    3. **Provide clear instructions** for what should be analyzed or improved at each step
    4. **Be actionable** - someone should be able to follow this structure to systematically improve the prompt
    5. **Include appropriate fields** such as:
       - Prompt analysis steps
       - Evaluation criteria
       - Improvement actions
       - Verification steps (if applicable)
    6. **Use descriptive keys** that clearly indicate what should be done at each step

    The reasoning structure should operationalize the adapted modules into a coherent, step-by-step plan for prompt improvement.

    **Output only the JSON reasoning structure without additional commentary.**

  stage2_solve: |
    # Stage 2: Improving Prompt with Discovered Reasoning Structure

    ## Instructions

    Follow the step-by-step reasoning plan in JSON format below to systematically improve the given prompt. Work through each step, providing concrete analysis and improvements as they apply to this particular prompt.

    ## Reasoning Structure

    {reasoning_structure}

    ## Original Prompt

    ```
    {main_prompt}
    ```

    ## Your Task

    1. **Follow the reasoning structure above step by step**
    2. **For each key in the JSON structure**, provide your specific analysis and improvements as they apply to this particular prompt
    3. **Work through each step sequentially**, building upon previous steps
    4. **Be concrete and specific** - use actual information from the prompt, not generic descriptions
    5. **Arrive at a final improved prompt** by completing all steps in the reasoning structure

    ## Output Format

    Work through each step of the reasoning structure, then provide:

    **Improved Prompt:**
    [Your complete improved prompt here - provide ONLY the improved prompt without explanations or meta-commentary]

    Begin improving the prompt now by following the reasoning structure.
